# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges. Advent of Code is an annual event with daily coding puzzles from December 1st to December 25th. Each puzzle provides an opportunity to improve programming skills and problem-solving abilities.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is created by Eric Wastl. It's designed to offer fun, interesting problems that can be solved in any programming language. The event is open to coders at all skill levels.

## Repository Structure

Each day's challenge is stored in a separate directory named `DayXX` where `XX` is the day of the challenge. For example, `Day01`, `Day02`, etc. Each directory will typically include:

- A `README.md` file explaining the day's challenge.
- Solution files in my chosen programming language.
- Any input data provided by Advent of Code for the challenge.

## How to Use This Repository

You can use this repository as a reference for your own Advent of Code solutions or to see different approaches to problem-solving. Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback or ask questions through issues and pull requests.

## Contributing

While the main purpose of this repository is personal skill development, I'm open to contributions in the form of:

- Optimizations or alternative solutions to problems.
- Fixes for any bugs or issues found in the solutions.
- Improvements to documentation or explanations.

Please feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
