## --- Part One ---

### Problem Description

At an observatory, you help an Elf researcher studying cosmic expansion. The researcher's data is compiled into a giant image with empty space (.) and galaxies (#). The task is to calculate the sum of the lengths of the shortest path between every pair of galaxies, considering the universe's expansion.

### Example

Initial data:
```
...#......
.......#..
#.........
..........
......#...
.#........
.........#
..........
.......#..
#...#.....
```

Expanded universe (rows and columns with no galaxies are doubled):
```
....#........
.........#...
#............
.............
.............
........#....
.#...........
............#
.............
.............
.........#...
#....#.......
```

### Task

1. Expand the universe by doubling the size of rows and columns with no galaxies.
2. Find the shortest path between every pair of galaxies.
3. Calculate the sum of these shortest path lengths.
