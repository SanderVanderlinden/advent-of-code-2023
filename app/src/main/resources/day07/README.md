# [Day 7: Camel Cards](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/7)

## --- Part One ---

### Problem Description

You're on Desert Island and need to figure out why the sand supply stopped. To pass the time while traveling, you learn Camel Cards, a game similar to poker but designed for camel rides. The game involves ordering hands of cards based on their strength.

### Rules of Camel Cards

- A hand consists of five cards labeled A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2.
- Hand types, from strongest to weakest: Five of a kind, Four of a kind, Full house, Three of a kind, Two pair, One pair, High card.
- Hands are ordered first by type, then by the strength of individual cards.

### Example

- Example hands:
  - 32T3K
  - T55J5
  - KK677
  - KTJJT
  - QQQJA

Each hand wins an amount equal to its bid multiplied by its rank. The first step is to put the hands in order of strength, then calculate the total winnings.

### Task

Determine the rank of every hand and calculate the total winnings for your set of hands.
