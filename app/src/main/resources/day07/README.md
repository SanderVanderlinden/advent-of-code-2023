You're on Desert Island, learning the game of Camel Cards to pass time. It's a game similar to poker, played while riding a camel. The game involves ordering hands of cards based on their strength, each hand consisting of five cards with specific labels.

### Rules of Camel Cards

- Hand types from strongest to weakest: Five of a kind, Four of a kind, Full house, Three of a kind, Two pair, One pair, High card.
- Hands are ordered first by type, then by the strength of individual cards.

### Task

### Additional Rule: Jokers

An additional rule introduces J cards as jokers or wildcards. J cards are now the weakest individual cards but can act as any card to make the hand the strongest type possible.

### Modified Task

With the joker rule, re-rank the hands and calculate the new total winnings.
