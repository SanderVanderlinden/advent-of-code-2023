## --- Part One ---

### Problem Description

While waiting at an oasis in the Desert Island, you decide to use your Oasis And Sand Instability Sensor (OASIS) to analyze the surroundings. The OASIS produces a report with many values changing over time. Your task is to extrapolate the next value in each history using a specific method.

### Example

Given histories:
- 0 3 6 9 12 15
- 1 3 6 10 15 21
- 10 13 16 21 30 45

Create sequences from the difference at each step of the history. Repeat this process using the newly generated sequence as input until all values are zeroes. Then, extrapolate the history.

### Task

Analyze the OASIS report and extrapolate the next value for each history. What is the sum of these extrapolated values?
