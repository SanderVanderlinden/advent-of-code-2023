# [Day 5: If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/5)

## --- Part One ---

### Problem Description

You've reached the gardener at Island Island and are tasked with assisting in food production. The Island Island Almanac
lists seeds, soils, fertilizers, water, light, temperature, humidity, and locations, all identified by numbers. Each
category's numbers are mapped to the next category's numbers, showing what combinations to use for optimal growth.

### Example

The almanac lists seeds and maps for converting numbers from one category to the next. For instance, the seed-to-soil
map shows which soil number corresponds to each seed number. The map lines contain three numbers: destination range
start, source range start, and range length, indicating how to convert a range of source numbers to destination numbers.

- seeds: 79 14 55 13
- seed-to-soil map:
    - 50 98 2
    - 52 50 48

The task is to find the lowest location number that corresponds to any of the initial seed numbers by converting each
seed number through the categories using the maps.

### Task

Determine the lowest location number that corresponds to any of the initial seed numbers.
