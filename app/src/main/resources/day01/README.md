# Day 1: Trebuchet?!

## Problem Description
Global snow production is facing issues, and the Elves need your help. They've marked fifty critical locations on a map where problems need to be addressed. The goal is to check all fifty stars by December 25th. The calibration document provided for adjusting the trebuchet has been inadvertently altered by a young Elf. The challenge involves recovering calibration values from each line of the document, formed by combining the first and last digits into a two-digit number.

## Example
In the example calibration document, the values are determined as follows:
- `1abc2` results in `12`
- `pqr3stu8vwx` results in `38`
- `a1b2c3d4e5f` results in `15`
- `treb7uchet` results in `77`

Adding these together produces a total of `142`.

## Task
Consider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all of the calibration values?
