## --- Part One ---

### Problem Description

You participate in toy boat races at Island Island. The races are won by the boat that travels the farthest within a fixed time limit. You're given a list of race times and record distances. You must figure out how to charge your boat (by holding a button) to ensure it travels farther than the record distance in each race.

### Example

- Race times and distances:
    - Time: 7 15 30
    - Distance: 9 40 200

Your boat's speed increases by 1 mm/ms for each millisecond you hold the button at the start of the race. The task is to determine how many ways you can beat the record in each race and what you get if you multiply these numbers together.

### Task

Calculate the number of ways to beat the record in each race and determine the product of these numbers.

## --- Part Two ---

### Problem Description

A misinterpretation of the race information reveals there's only one race, not multiple. The race times and distances are a single number, not separated.

### Example

- Single race:
    - Time: 71530
    - Distance: 940200

The task is now to find out how many ways there are to win this one long race.

### Task

Determine how many ways you can beat the record in the single, long race.
