### Problem Description

At the hot springs, you need to help repair the damaged condition records of the springs. The springs are arranged in rows, marked as operational (.) or damaged (#), but some conditions are unknown (?). The task is to figure out how many different arrangements of operational and damaged springs fit the given criteria for each row.

### Example

Damaged records with unknown conditions:
```
???.### 1,1,3
.??..??...?##. 1,1,3
?#?#?#?#?#?#?#? 1,3,1,6
????.#...#... 4,1,1
????.######..#####. 1,6,5
?###???????? 3,2,1
```
