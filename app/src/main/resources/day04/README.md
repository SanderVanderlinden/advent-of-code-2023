# [Day 4: Scratchcards](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4)

## --- Part One ---

### Problem Description

You arrive at Island Island via gondola and meet an Elf with a pile of colorful scratchcards. Each card has two lists of numbers separated by a vertical bar (|): a list of winning numbers and then a list of numbers you have. The task is to figure out which of the numbers you have appear in the list of winning numbers. The first match makes the card worth one point, and each subsequent match doubles the card's point value.

### Example

- Card 1: `41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86 6 31 17 9 48 53`
- Card 2: `13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19`
- Card 3: `1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14 1`
- Card 4: `41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58 5 54 83`
- Card 5: `87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36`
- Card 6: `31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11`

In this example, the total points from the scratchcards are 13.

### Task

Determine the total points value of all the scratchcards in the Elf's pile.
