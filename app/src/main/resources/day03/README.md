### Problem Description

After reaching a gondola lift station with an Elf, you discover the gondolas aren't functioning due to a missing engine
part. To identify the missing part, you need to sum up all the part numbers in the engine schematic. The schematic
displays various numbers and symbols. A number is considered a part number if it's adjacent to a symbol (including
diagonally). Periods (.) do not count as symbols.

#### Example Engine Schematic

```467..114..
.........
..35..633.
......#...
617......
.....+.58.
..592.....
......755.
...$.*....
.664.598..
```

In this example, most numbers are part numbers except for 114 and 58. The sum of the part numbers is 4361.

#### Task

Calculate the sum of all the part numbers in the actual, larger engine schematic provided in your puzzle input.
